# Habit & Workout Tracker

A full-stack habit and workout tracking app built with React, Express, and MongoDB. Users can log daily habits and visualize weekly progress.

## Features
- Create, complete, and delete habits/workouts
- Weekly progress chart (data visualization)
- Responsive dashboard
- Persistent MongoDB storage

## Tech Stack
React, Express, MongoDB, Recharts

## Reflection
The hardest part was aggregating weekly data correctly for charts. I’m most proud of building a clean end-to-end flow from database to visualization. Next time, I would deploy earlier to reduce last-minute debugging. I incorporated feedback by narrowing scope and focusing on a solid MVP with one strong advanced feature.
